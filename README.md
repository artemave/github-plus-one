GitHub has issues. Some are worse than others. But you can't really tell. Except now you can! Simply install [github-plus-one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-%201/oiiklolboagjicidmggcoohmgkepdfan) chrome extension and go  ruthlessly upvote issues (and pull requests) and make the world a better place.

Of course this would actually be a useful thing if one could also sort issues by votes.  This however is much more of a technical challenge, so I'll leave it to Github. Hopefully a feature like this is not far down their pipeline. 
The purpose of this extension is rather to give people a taste of how it could be. And of course to disrupt Github greyness with an awesome looking button.
